Oil & Gas Production Performance Dashboard

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end Power BI dashboard developed to analyze upstream oil & gas production performance at multiple levels including executive overview, well performance, field & asset analysis, and downtime impact.

The project demonstrates how production data can be transformed into actionable operational insights using data analytics and domain knowledge.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor overall oil, gas, and water production trends
Compare well-wise production performance
Analyze field-wise and asset-wise production distribution
Evaluate operational downtime and its impact on oil production
Support data-driven decision-making in upstream operations

📊 Dashboard Pages & Insights
1️⃣ Executive Overview

Purpose: High-level snapshot for management.

Key Insights:

Displays cumulative Total Oil, Total Gas, GOR, and Water Cut %
Production trends over time highlight stable vs fluctuating periods
Identifies top- and low-performing wells at a glance

2️⃣ Well Production Performance Overview

Purpose: Detailed analysis at the well level.

Key Insights:
